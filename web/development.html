<h3>Development status</h3>

<p>We continue to install updates in the tex4ht development source and
propagate them to TeX, although we have not made a full release in
tex4ht. Some development changes remain solely in the <a
href="http://svn.gnu.org.ua/viewvc/tex4ht">source repository</a>.

<p>TeX4ht was created by Eitan Gurari at Ohio State University.  <a
href="/TUGboat/tb30-2/tb95gurari.pdf">Eitan died unexpectedly</a> in
June 2009; we extend our sympathies to his family, and dedicate future
work on the project to his memory.

<p>With the encouragement and support of Eitan's family,
Michal&nbsp;Hoftich, Karl&nbsp;Berry, and others have continued to work
on TeX4ht. Involvement by other volunteers, from bug reports to major
new development, is welcome and needed.

<p>No full post-Eitan release has been made to date. This continues to
be a work in progress.
