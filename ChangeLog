	* doc,
	* bin: remove the setop-level directories; they
	contained only derived files generated long ago,
	or otherwise duplicated within lit/. Relics of attempts
	of the initial import of Eitan's stuff, as I recall.

	* tests: new dir with assorted tests.
	* src/tests/testa.tex: move again, now to tests/.
	* src/tests/testb.tex: turns out it's the same as testa, remove.
